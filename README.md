Application start with --- nodemon index.js

1. Which database you have chosen and why?
I chose MongoDB as the database for this assignment. The decision was influenced by my previous experience with MongoDB, which made it easier for me to set up and manage the database. MongoDB's flexible schema design also aligns well with the hierarchical structure of categories, subcategories, and items, allowing for efficient data modeling and querying.

2. Three things you learned from this assignment:
Schema Referencing: I learned how to effectively reference data across different schemas, which is essential for maintaining relationships between categories, subcategories, and items.
Consistency: The importance of maintaining consistent data across different parts of the application became clear, especially when dealing with multiple related entities.
Error Handling: I gained a deeper understanding of how to handle errors gracefully, both in API development and during testing, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience.

3. What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
The most challenging aspect of the assignment was API testing and error handling. Ensuring that the API responded correctly under various conditions and handling potential errors in a way that was both informative and secure required careful consideration and debugging.

4. What would you have done differently given more time?
Given more time, I would have focused on writing more readable and maintainable code. This includes better organization of the codebase, using more descriptive variable names, and adding comprehensive comments and documentation to make the code easier to understand and extend in the future.
